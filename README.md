# Currency

## About the Project

Diploma project. The subject of the graduate qualification work is “Mobile application for the Android operating system "Currency calculator””.

These tasks that were solved during the study: 
 - Development a mobile application for the Android operating system "Currency Calculator", including the following main functions: 
   - Start-up screen with choice of the language and main currency
   - Getting the user-defined value of currency
   - Drawing diagrams of the currency value for several main periods: week, month, 6 months, year, 5 years and a user-selectable interval \
   - Currency value forecasting for the next day based on the last month data.

As a result of the work a ready-to-use software product was developed that will allow the user to get basic information about the exchange rate in the shortest possible time, check the dynamics of the change in the value of the currency for the period of time chosen by him, and as well as get an approximate value of the currency for tomorrow based on the data for the last month.

## Feautures

 - Quick access to the current exchange rate
 - Support for a large number of different currencies
 - Currency calculator
 - Displaying changes in the value of currencies on charts
 - Support for multiple interface languages
 - Support for the latest Android OS versions
 - Using the principles of Material Design when developing an application
